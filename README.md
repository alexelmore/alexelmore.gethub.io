<h1> Alex Elmore</h1>
<hr>
<p> My name is Alex Elmore I enjoy reading about current affairs and watching sports, particularly tennis, Royals baseball and the NBA. I played tennis at William Jewell College, where I got a degree in Political Science and a minor in American History. I still enjoy playing tennis in my spare time. I am also a runner and run almost every day. </p>
